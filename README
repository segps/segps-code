SE-GPS takes advantage of Semantic Web technologies to establish traceability links between vulnerability repositories and other software repositories using a unified knowledge representation. More specifically, SEGPS takes advantage of knowledge captured in software build repositories (e.g., MAVEN) and establish bi-directional traceability links to a specialized software security vulnerabilities databases (e.g., National Vulnerability Database (NVD)).
